# FlySFO Departing Flights

So basically, this is a small `Scrapy` + `Selenium` + `ChromeDriver` project that gets San Francisco International Airport (SFO)'s departing flights from https://www.flysfo.com/

The command below will activate the `Scrapy` framework and download all the flights:

`scrapy crawl FlySFO`
